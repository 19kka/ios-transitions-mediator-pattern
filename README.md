Cleaner transitions between iOS View Controllers with the Mediator Design Pattern

This project contains the project discussed in the cocoapatterns.com article "Cleaner iOS view controller transitions with the Mediator Design Pattern".

It proposes an alternative way of handling transitions between view controllers compared to the widely used ones that couple view controllers tightly and don't leave much room for extending the codebase without modifying existing code.
